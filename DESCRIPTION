Title: Light-weight, mustache-based SQL templating
Version: 0.6
Date: 2015-01-21
Authors@R: "Christopher Brown <chris.brown@decisionpatterns.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: Provides a very simple-to-use SQL templating system based on
    mustache (whisker) templates. SQL templates are syntactically, correct SQL
    and can be executed as-is or rendered programmatically. In many cases, this
    allows shared SQL queries between R and other other developers such as DBAs.
    Little burden is placed on SQL authors for writing the templates.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.1.0)
Imports:
    whisker,
    whisker.tools
